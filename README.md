## General Information
- This project focuses on the classification of skin cancer types using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- The goal is to create a model capable of accurately detecting different skin cancer types.
- The project addresses issues such as overfitting, class imbalances, and data augmentation.
- The dataset used contains approximately 2357 images of skin cancer types, divided into 9 sub-directories representing different classes.

## Conclusions
- Initial observations revealed overfitting in the model, which was effectively addressed through the integration of data augmentation techniques.
- Detecting class imbalance, we utilized the Augmentor library to bolster the representation of minority classes, thereby achieving a more equitable dataset distribution.
- Following the resolution of overfitting and class imbalances, noticeable enhancements were observed during the training process.
- Employing data augmentation yielded tangible improvements in the model's performance, validating its effectiveness.
