## General Information
-The primary objective of this project is to employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the classification of various types of skin cancer.
-Our aim is to develop a model proficient in accurately identifying different skin cancer types.
-Throughout the project, we tackle challenges including overfitting, class imbalances, and the implementation of data augmentation techniques.
-The dataset utilized comprises approximately 2357 images depicting different skin cancer types, organized into 9 sub-directories representing distinct classes.


## Conclusions
- Initial observations revealed overfitting in the model, which was effectively addressed through the integration of data augmentation techniques.
- Detecting class imbalance, we utilized the Augmentor library to bolster the representation of minority classes, thereby achieving a more equitable dataset distribution.
- Following the resolution of overfitting and class imbalances, noticeable enhancements were observed during the training process.
- Employing data augmentation yielded tangible improvements in the model's performance, validating its effectiveness.
